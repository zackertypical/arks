                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                            The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                            - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                            - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                      There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                      Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                      Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                      to the local namespace of the Route.

                      Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                      boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                      allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                      Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                      generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                      <gateway:experimental:description>
                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                      routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                      any namespace to the Service.

                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                      "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                      connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                      the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                      ParentRef of the Route.

                      Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                      differently based on the type of parent resource.

                      When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                      listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                      select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                      must match both specified values.

                      <gateway:experimental:description>
                      When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                      Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                      the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.
                      </gateway:experimental:description>

                      Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                      document how/if Port is interpreted.

                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                      * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                      are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                      both specified values.

                      are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                      both specified values.

                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                      If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                      interpreted.

                      When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                      least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                      the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                      Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              exact string match. (See
                              https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                              If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                              entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                              entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                              If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                              purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                              capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                              match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                              as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                              the Gateway API.

                              Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                              themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                    HTTPBackendRef defines how a HTTPRoute forwards a HTTP request.

                    Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
                    ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                    namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                    documentation for details.

                    <gateway:experimental:description>

                    When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                    honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

                    Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                    Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

                    If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                    backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                    protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

                    If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                    protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                    "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                    and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                    well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.

                                    Listener port.

                                  Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                    description: |-
                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                    When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                    honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

                    Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                    Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

                    If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                    backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                    protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

                    If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                    protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                    "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                        Weight specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the referenced

                        the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                        implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                        weights does not need to equal 100.

                        If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                        of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                        traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
                        defaults to 1.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
